#get the data.

#plot timestamps vs xposition
mt_plot(ss1, x = "timestamps", y = "xpos", color = "trial_type")
#exclude the initial times
ss2 = mt_exclude_initiation(ss1)
#now plotting again
mt_plot(ss2, x = "timestamps", y = "xpos", color = "trial_type")
#plotting x-position vs y-postion
mt_plot(ss2, color = "trial_type")
#comparing where the inital times arent removed:
mt_plot(ss1, color = "trial_type")
#playing with time normalization.
ss3 = mt_time_normalize(ss2, nsteps = 1000)
#plotting it
mt_plot(ss3, use = "tn_trajectories", color = "trial_type")
#trying nsteps 5
ss4 = mt_time_normalize(ss2, nsteps = 5)
#and plotting
mt_plot(ss4, use = "tn_trajectories", color = "trial_type")
#setting it back to default which is 101.
ss3 = mt_time_normalize(ss2, nsteps = 101)
# plotting the aggregated data both with the normalized and non-normalized time.
mt_plot_aggregate(ss3, color = "trial_type")
mt_plot_aggregate(ss3, use = "tn_trajectories",color = "trial_type")
#looks best with the normalized.

#getting numeric results.
results = mt_measures(ss3, use = "tn_trajectories")

#making a nice table for Maxmial distance and xpos_flips w/e that is.
mt_aggregate(results, use_variables = c("MAD", "xpos_flips"), use2_variables = "trial_type")
this is cordulas results, nice.
